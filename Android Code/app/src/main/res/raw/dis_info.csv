Actinic Keratoses (akiec),rough scaly patch on the skin that develops from years of sun exposure. It's often found on the face lips ears forearms scalp neck or back of the hands.,Medium,Actinic keratosis is caused by frequent or intense exposure to UV rays from the sun or tanning beds.,"""Sun safety is necessary to help prevent development and recurrence of actinic keratosis patches and spots. Limit your time in the sun. Especially avoid time in the sun between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. And avoid staying in the sun so long that you get a sunburn or a suntan. Use sunscreen. Before spending time outdoors even on cloud days apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 as the American Academy of Dermatology recommends. Use sunscreen on all exposed skin and use lip balm with sunscreen on your lips. Apply sunscreen at least 15 minutes before going outside and reapply it every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or perspiring. Sunscreen is not recommended for babies under 6 months. Rather keep them out of the sun if possible or protect them with shade hats and clothing that covers the arms and legs. Cover up. For extra protection from the sun, wear tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs. Also wear a broad-brimmed hat which provides more protection than does a baseball cap or golf visor. Avoid tanning beds. The UV exposure from a tanning bed can cause just as much skin damage as a tan acquired from the sun.Check your skin regularly and report changes to your doctor. Examine your skin regularly looking for the development of new skin growths or changes in existing moles freckles bumps and birthmarks. With the help of mirrors check your face neck ears and scalp. Examine the tops and undersides of your arms and hands."""
Basal cell carcinoma (bcc),type of skin cancer often appears as a slightly transparent bump on the skin A brown black or blue lesion,Medium,Chronic sun exposure Radiation therapyExposure to arsenicImmune-suppressing drugs.,Avoid the sun during the middle of the dayWear sunscreen year-round Avoid tanning beds
Benign keratosis (bkl),common noncancerous skin growth. People tend to get more of them as they get olderusually brown black or light tan. The growths look waxy scaly and slightly raised. They usually appear on the head neck chest or back,Low,Doctors don't know exactly what causes seborrheic keratoses. The growths tend to run in some families so genes may play a role.,You should see a doctor if many growths develop over a short time. The growths get irritated or bleed when your clothing rubs against them. You may want the growths removed. You notice suspicious changes in your skin such as sores or growths that grow rapidly bleed and don't heal. These could be signs of skin cancer.
Dermatofibroma (df),small harmless growths that appear on the skin.most common on the arms lower legs and upper back.are typically pink to light brown in light skin and dark brown or black in dark skin,Medium,a possible cause is an adverse reaction to a local trauma such as a small injury or bug bite in the area where the lesion later forms.Age may be another risk factor as the growths appear mostly in adults,Most dermatofibromas do not require treatment Pinch test Dermatofibroma removal
Melanoma (mel),most serious type of skin cancer develops in the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin — the pigment that gives your skin its color.,High,occurs when something goes wrong in the melanin-producing cells (melanocytes) that give color to your skin.t's likely that a combination of factors including environmental and genetic factors causes melanoma.,Avoid the sun during the middle of the day.Wear protective clothing Become familiar with your skin so that you'll notice changes.Radiation therapy Surgery to remove affected lymph nodes
Melanocytic nevi (nv),dummy,Medium,"The cause is not clearly understood but is thought to be caused by a defect in embryologic development. This is in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. The defect is thought to cause a proliferation of melanocytes. This means melanocytes the cells in the body in charge of normal skin color are being produced at an extremely fast rate thus causing the melanocytes to form in clusters instead of spread out causing abnormal skin pigmentation in some areas of the body. Genes can have an influence on a person's moles. Dysplastic nevus syndrome is a largely hereditary condition which causes a person to have a large quantity of moles (often 100 or more) with some larger than normal or atypical. This often leads to a higher risk of melanoma a serious skin cancer. Dysplastic nevi are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. Dysplastic nevi are common and many people have a few of these abnormal moles. Having more than 50 ordinary moles increases the risk of developing melanoma. In the overall population a slight majority of melanomas do not form in an existing mole but rather create a new growth on the skin. Somewhat surprisingly this also applies to those with dysplastic nevi. They are at a higher risk of melanoma occurring not only where there is an existing mole but also where there are none. Such persons need to be checked regularly for any changes in their moles and to note any new ones. Ultraviolet light from the sun causes premature aging of the skin and skin damage that can lead to melanoma. Some scientists hypothesize that overexposure to UV including excessive sunlight may play a role in the formation of acquired moles. However more research is needed to determine the complex interaction between genetic makeup and overall exposure to ultraviolet light. Some strong indications that this is so (but falling short of proof)are: The relative lack of moles on the buttocks of people with dysplastic nevi. Freckles (spots of melanin on the skin and distinct from moles) are known to be influenced by sunlight. Studies have found that sunburns and too much time in the sun can increase the risk factors for melanoma. This is in addition to those who have dysplastic nevi being at higher risk of this cancer (the uncertainty is in regard to acquiring benign moles). To prevent and reduce the risk of melanoma caused by UV radiation the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Cancer Institute recommends staying out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. standard time (or whenever one's shadow is shorter than one's height). The National Cancer Institute also recommends wearing long sleeves and trousers hats with a wide brim sunscreens and sunglasses that have UV-deflecting lenses.",You should consult a doctor for this.
Vascular skin (vasc),common abnormalities of the skin and underlying tissues more commonly known as birthmarks,Low,dummy,dummy
